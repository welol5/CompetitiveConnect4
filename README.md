# Competitive Connect 4

## Project Description

Competitive Connect 4, or CC4, is a website where players can login and play Connect 4 with others. Players enter a queue where they will be matched with other players, then they are able to play live with the user with whom they were matched. Players can see their profile to check their rank and edit their account, as well as a leaderboard on the home page.

git clone https://github.com/welol5/CompetitiveConnect4

First, you will need to install a local Tomcat server.

Next, on the toolbar at the top of IntelliJ, click the down arrow just to the left of the Run and Debug icons. There will be an option to Edit Configurations. In the resulting popup, click the Add icon, then click Tomcat and Local.

From that dialog, you will need to click the Configure... button next to Application Server to tell IntelliJ where Tomcat is installed.

Go to Deployment tab and select Artifact. Apply
